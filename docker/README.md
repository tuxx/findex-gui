Docker containers for Findex GUI
====

*Use at your own risk*


Running
===
- Run `build.sh` to build the containers
- Run `rundocker.sh` to run the containers - findex still exits at the moment.
- Tearing down the containers is still done manually, check `docker ps` and `docker stop <containerid>`
